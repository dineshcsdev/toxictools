## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get ToxicTools up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ (recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dineshcsdev/ToxicTools.git
    cd ToxicTools
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is not present, generate it first by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing Flask, python-dotenv, and openai.)*

4.  **Configure your OpenRouter API Key:**
    *   Obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `ToxicTools` directory.
    *   Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:
        ```
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
        ```
        Replace `your_key_here` with your actual API key.

### Running the Application

```bash
flask run
```

Alternatively, you can run it directly:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
